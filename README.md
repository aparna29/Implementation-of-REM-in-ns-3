# Implementation-of-Random-Exponential-Marking-REM-in-ns-3
REM is an active queue management algorithm like Random Early Detection (RED), but differs in the following aspects: (i) the way congestion is measured, and (ii) how the measured congestion is related to the dropping probability. REM is implemented in ns-2, and this project aims to implement it in ns-3.
